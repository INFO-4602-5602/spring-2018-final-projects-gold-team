The projects visuals are built using a Jupyter notebook and python

The file has a few dependencies to run. One is a python interpreter itself, 
the code used here is python3. The others are libraries within python, specifically
Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pylab. 

For Windows, a simple pip command should install these just fine

This should get each of the dependencies when run in the command terminal
python -m pip install --user numpy matplotlib jupyter pandas
